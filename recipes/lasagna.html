      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>
        When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than
        20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our
        top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more
        than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular
        lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John
        unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old.
